# Object-detection
This project implements a real-time object detection system using Python, OpenCV, and a pre-trained MobileNetSSD model. The system captures live video from a webcam, processes each frame, and detects common objects like people, cars, and animals, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores around detected objects in real time.
